00000	Though I haven't heard of that, I've seen the reports on this, on the Senate investigating committee that they've been talking about.
00001	It'd be very, very bad to have a rash of investigation.
00002	Yes.
00003	It'd be a three-ring circus.
00004	I think he would be a good man.
00005	He's a good man, but I'm not so certain as to the matter of the publicity that he might seek on it.
00006	A good man.
00007	I think so.
00008	Be an excellent man.
00010	That's right.
00011	I know of him but I don't know him.
00012	I saw him on TV the other night for the first time; he handled himself well on that.
00013	Oh yes I know.
00014	Yes, I know him.
00015	Well, that's mighty nice of you, Mister President.
00016	We'll be.
00017	We hope to have this thing wrapped up today.
00018	We probably won't get it before the first of the week.
00019	This angle in Mexico is giving us a great deal of trouble.
00020	Because the stories, they have this man, Oswald, getting sixty five hundred dollars from the Cuban embassy.
00021	Coming back to this country with it.
00022	We're not able to prove that fact.
00023	The information was that he was there on the eighteenth.
00024	We are able to prove conclusively he was in New Orleans that day.
00025	The story came in changing the date to the tewnty eighth of September. 
00026	The Mexican police have again arrested this woman, Duran.
00027	They'll hold her for two or three more days.
00028	We're going to confront her with the original informant.
00029	And we're also going to put the lie detector test on him.
00030	Meantime of course Castro's hollering his head off.
00031	I would not pay one hundred per cent attention to them.
00032	All that they are is a psychological asset in an investigation.
00033	I wouldn't want to be a part to sending a man to the chair on a lie detector.
00034	For instance, we have found many cases where we've used 'em in a bank where there has been embezzlement, and a person will confess before the lie detector test is finished.
00035	More or less fearful of the fact that the lie detector test will show them guilty.
00036	Psychologically, the have that advantage.
00037	It's a misnomer to call it a lie detector.
00038	What it really is is the evaluation of a chart that is made by this machine.
00039	And that evaluation is made by a human being.
00040	And any human being can be apt to make a wrong interpretation.
00041	So I would not myself go on that alone.
00042	There's no question but that he is the man.
00043	The fingerprints and things that we have.
00044	This fellow Rubenstein down there, he has offered to take the lie detector test, but his lawyer has got to be, of course, consulted first, and I doubt whether the lawyer will allow it.
00045	He's one of those criminal lawyers from the west coast.
00046	Somewhat like a Edward Bennett Williams type, and almost as much of a shyster.
00047	At the present time we have not.
00048	This fellow had been in this night club, this strip tease joint that he had, but that has not been able to be confirmed.
00049	This fellow Rubenstein is a very shady character, has a bad record, street brawler, fighter, and that sort of thing.
00050	In the place in Dallas, if a fellow came in there and couldn't pay his bill completely, Rubenstein would beat the very devil out of him and then throw him out of the place.
00051	He was that kind of a fellow.
00052	He didn't drink, didn't smoke, boasted about that.
00053	He is what I would put in the category, one of those egomaniacs.
00054	He likes to be in the limelight.
00055	He knew all the police in the white light district where the joints are down there.
00056	And he also let 'em come in, see the show, get food, and get liquor, and so forth.
00057	That's how I think ge got into police headquarters.
00058	They accepted him as kind of a police character hanging around police headquarters.
00059	Of course, they never made any moves, as the pictures show, even when they saw him approaching.
00060	Got up right to him and pressed his pistol against Oswald's stomach.
00061	Neither of the police officers on either side made any move to push him away or to grab him.
00062	Wasn't until after the gun was fired that they then moved.
00063	Secondly, the Chief of Police admits that he moved him in the morning as a convenience and at the request of a motion picture people who wanted to have daylight.
00064	Now of course that is not the highest degree of efficiency, certainly to say.
00065	He should have moved him at night.
00066	And those derelictions in that phase.
00067	But so far as tying Rubenstein and Oswald together, we haven't as yet done so.
00068	But then a number of stories come in.
00069	We have tied Oswald into the Civil Liberties Union in New York, membership into that.
00070	And in course into this Cuban Fair Play Commission - Committee - which is pro-Castro and dominated by Communism, and financed to some extent by the Castro government.
00071	Two of the shots fired at the President were splintered, but they had characteristics on 'em so that our ballistic expert was able to prove that they were fired by this gun.
00072	He was hit by the first and the third.
00073	The second shot hit the governor.
00074	The third shot is a completely, is a complete bullet that wasn't shattered, and that rolled out of the President's head and tore a large part of the President's head off.
00075	In trying to massage his heart, at the, on the, at the hospital, on the way to the hospital, they apparently loosened that, and that fell onto the stretcher.
00076	We recovered that, and we have that.
00077	We have the gun here also.
00078	They were aiming directly at the President.
00079	There's no question about that.
00080	This telescopic lens, which I've looked through, it brings a person as close to you as if they were sittin' right beside you.
00081	We also have tested the fact that you could fire those three shots were fired within three seconds.
00082	There's been some stories going around in the papers and so forth that must have been more than one man because no one man could fire those shots in the time that they were fired.
00083	We've just proved that by the actual test that we've made.
00084	Connally turned to the President as the, when the first shot was fired.
00085	And I think in that, in that turning, it was where he got hit.
00086	I think that's very likely.
00087	No, the President wasn't hit with the second one.
00088	The president no doubt would have been hit.
00089	He would been hit three times.
00090	On the fifth floor of that building where we found the gun, and the wrapping paper in which the gun was wrapped, had been wrapped, and upon which we find the full fingerprints of this man Oswald, on that floor we found the three empty shells that had been fired, and one shell that had not been fired.
00091	Other words there were four shells, apparently, and he had, he had fired three, but didn't fire the fourth one.
00092	He then threw the gun aside and came down and, at the, at the entrance of the building, he was stopped by a police officer, and some worker, some manager in the building, told the police officer well he's all right, he works here.
00093	You needn't hold him.
00094	So they let him go.
00095	That's how he got out.
00096	And then he got on a bus.
00097	The bus driver has identified him.
00098	And went out to his home.
00099	Got hold of a jacket.
00100	Then came back downtown.
00101	Walking downtown.
00102	The police officer who was killed stopped him, not knowing who he was or not whether he was the man, but they were, just on suspicion, and he fired of course and killed the police officer.
00103	Oh yes, we can prove that.
00104	The he walked about another two blocks and went to the theater.
00105	And the woman at the theater window, selling the tickets, she was so suspicious, the way he was acting, and she said he was carrying a gun, he had a revolver at that time, with which he had killed the police officer.
00106	He went into the theater, and she notified the police.
00107	The police, and our man down there, went in there and located this particular man.
00108	We had quite a struggle with him, he fought like a, like a lion.
00109	He had to be subdued, of course.
00110	Was then brought out and of course taken to the police headquarters.
00111	He apparently had come down the flve flights of steps, a stairway from the fifth floor.
00112	So far as we've found out, the elevator was not used, although he could have used it, but nobody remembers whether it was or whether it wasn't.
00113	I tihnk that's correct.
00114	That's what we're trying to nail down now.
00115	He was strogly pro-Castro.
00116	He was strongly anti-American.
00117	He had been in correspondence, which we have, with the Soviet embassy here in Washington, and with the American Civil Liberties Union, and with this Committee for Fair Play to Cuba.
00118	We have copies of the correspondence.
00119	We've got him nailed down in, in his contact with them.
00120	None of those letters, however, dealt with any indication of violence.
00121	Or contemplated assassination.
00122	They were dealing with the matter of a visa for wis wife to go back to Russia.
00123	Now there's one angle of this thing that I'm hopeful to get some word on today.
00124	This woman, his wife, has been very hostile.
00125	She would not cooperate.
00126	She speaks Russian and Russian only.
00127	She did say to us yesterday down there that if we could give her assurance that she would be allowed in this country, she might cooperate.
00128	I told our agents down there to give her that assurance.
00129	She could stay in this country.
00130	I sent a Russian-speaking agent into Dalles last night to interview her.
00131	We've got her now.
00132	He had access on all floors.
00133	Didn't have particular office.
00134	Orders came in for certain books, and some books would be on the first floor, second floor, third floor, and so forth.
00135	No particular place that he was stationed, at all.
00136	He was just a general packer of the requisitions that came in for school books from the, from the Dallas schools.
00137	Therefore he had access, perfectly proper access, to the fifth floor and the sixth floor.
00138	Usually, most of the employees were down on lower floors.
00139	He was seen on the fifth floor by one of the workmen.
00140	He was seen there.
00141	Taken of the parade and showing Missus Kennedy climibing out of the back seat.
00142	There was no Secret Service man standing on the back of the car.
00143	Usually the Presidential car, in the past, has had steps on the back next to the bumpers, and there's usually been one on either side standing on those steps, that the, at the back bumper.
00144	Whether the President asked that that not be done, we don't know.
00145	The bubble top was not up.
00146	But the bubble top wasn't worth a damn anyway 'cause it made entirely of, of, of plastic.
00147	Much to my surprise, the Secret Service do not have any armored cars.
00148	Oh yes, I do.
00149	I think you most certainly should have one.
00150	Most certainly should.
00151	We have one in New York.
00152	We use it for, for different purposes.
00153	I use it here for myself.
00154	And if we have any raids to make, or have to surround a place where anybody's hidden in, we use the bulletproof car on that.
00155	But it means that the top has to remain up.
00156	Cause you can bulletproof the entire car including the glass.
00157	You could never let the top down.
00158	But I do think you ought to have a bulletproof car.
00159	I was surprised the other day when I made inquiry.
00160	All that I understand the Secret Service has had, has had two cars metal plates underneath the car.
00161	To take care of a hand grenade or a bomb that might be thrown out and roll along the street.
00162	Well, of course, wo don't do those things in this country.
00163	In Europe, that's the way they assassinate the heads of state, with bombs.
00164	They've been after General De Gaulle, you know, with that sort of thing.
00165	But in this country, all our assassinations have been with guns.
00166	Very definitely, I was very much surprised when I learned that this bubble top thing was not bulletproof in any respect.
00167	The plastic top to it was down, of course; the President had insisted upon that, so that he could stand up and wave to the crowd.
00168	It seems to me that the President ought to always be in a bulletproof car.
00169	It certianly would prevent anything like this ever happening again.
00170	You could have a thousand Secret Service men on guard, and still a sniper can snipe you from up in the window, if you are exposed like the President was.
00171	But he can't do it if you have a, have a solid top bulletproof top to it.
00172	As it should be.
00173	Well I would certainly think so, Mister President.
00174	I think it ought to be done very quietly.
00175	There's a concern that's out I think in Cincinnati where we have our cars bulletproofed.
00176	I think we've got four. We've gon one on the west coast, one in New York, and one here.
00177	I think it can be done quietly, without any publicity being given to it, or any pictures being taken of it, if it's handled properly.
00178	But I think you ought to have the cars on that ranch there. It's perfectly easy for somebody to get onto the rach.
00179	By all means.
00180	You've got to really almost be in the capacity of a so-called prisoner.
00181	Because without that security, anything can be done.
00182	Now we've got a lot of letters and phone calls over the last three or four or five days.
00183	Got one about this parade the other day.
00184	They were going to try to kill you then.
00185	I talked with the Attorney General about it.
00186	I was very much opposed to that marching.
00187	That's what Bobby told me.
00188	When I heard of it, I talked with the Secret Service and they were very much opposed to it.
00189	I was very much opposed to it because it was even worse than down there in Dallas.
00190	Somebody on the sidewalk could dash out.
00191	While they had police assigned along the curbstone looking at the crowd, when the parade came along the police turned around and looked at the parade!
00192	I'll be very glad to indeed.
00193	On the other hand, if this fellow Oswald had lived, and had taken the lie detector test, and it had shown definitely that he had done these various things, together with the evidence that we very definitely have, it would have just added that, that much more strength to it.
00194	But he didn't.
00195	I'm not as enthusiastic about McCloy.
